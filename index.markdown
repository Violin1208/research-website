I am a PhD candidate at UCL and my PhD is part of a collaborative project between the British Museum and UCL. My research interests are in the areas of machine learning in Python, Natural Language Processing (NLP), knowledge representation, visualisation, network analysis and Collections as Data (CAD).

I also teach part-time at UCL and lead the Learning and Teaching team for 'She Loves Data' in EMEA region. 

I love working with data and am passionate about empowering women with data and technology.
